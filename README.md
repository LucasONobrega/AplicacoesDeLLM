**Abstract**

Metacritic is a website that summarizes reviews of movies, games and music published by users and entertainment media into a single score called Metascore. In recent years, this has become one of the parameters for gamers to determine which games are up or down and which products they decide to consume. Some recent works have used the support of Large Language Models (LLM) to automatically perform text summarization and topic detection in diverse contents. In this context, we note the importance of studying Metacritic’s reviews and, through these studies, understanding the reason for the high level of attention to its content. Thus, the present work seeks to contribute to this task by using the powers of a LLM to summarize the Metacritic's reviews.
