            "First off the games all about a story, the menu opens up and it starts with a fart in the wind blowing and and an unlocked window. From what I take from it the games got wierd angled storyline, its about Child exploitation subliminally or even if theres no sex. I don't want to be a 40 year old with a 14 year old girl. the game is.18 and.over you're not.even allowed to.play it if your her age group. the subliminal aside i.cant follow the storyline at all. even stoned. I sold thjs game and the only.people that wanted it looked like incestual fathers and sex offenders who want to.see w 14 year old. after all the remakes and deprived games.sony made.i dont get the story line or hype. the actual game.is.good its got.a bit of everything snd the controls are not clunky. it's still.missing.controls though like.typical japanese graphics.are.best I ever seen in real.time bht i skipped through them and what I amnleft with is a typical game on rails. the ai doesnt change the replay value is too see this chick. I had 14 yewr old girlfroend in 2013. it threw me off. Its one creepy relationship, this girl. is the emo cutter type or.street hooker and a fully grown man. such a wierd type.of setting for millions. this game overrated no one rrwlly wants to.see that. The Last Of Us is an amazing game with an amazing graphics and a great story. The characters are great, I really fell in love with Ellie and this was actually the first game I cried during the game So, the story is great, graphics are great, characters are great, but when it comes to the gameplay, it was nothing special, it was okay, but it was not smooth enough for my taste. The game is amazing, but it's a game so for me the gameplay is the most important thing and that's why I can't give it 10/10, but I'm really looking forward what kind of masterpiece ND will make for PS4, and if they make TLOU 2 with better graphics, it will probably get 10/10 from me. I finished the game on Hard and Survivor and wow, I am amazed by the quality of the graphics, I loved the storyline and the soundtrack is beautiful, I've already learnt the theme song on guitar... I didnt have any hype actually for this game until the review's started coming out with all the tens. I quickly later understood that this game would be amazing. Now back to my review, I've never experienced a better intro, just such a brilliant intro. The voice acting is phenomenal and just feels so natural and every character had such an fantastic script, I couldn't almost wait for the next cutscene which also were beautifully made. I haven't been a super fan of Uncharted but I loved the gameplay in The Last of Us, I never had any problems with the stealth parts and the firearms worked very good with the design, the feeling and the sound. I think that it was a good thing to make the allies invincible to the targets but sometimes they could get in the way and pull you out of the game sometimes, but it wasn't any gamebreaking things or over all annoying. The customization was good but it would be nice with something yet more deep. The story was so immersive and fantastic that it will be a experience that will never leave me. I'm not gonna talk to much about the multiplayer but I will say that it's as everything else, fantastic. I expected something decent but what I got was one of the funniest mulitplayer I've played for a long time, this coming from a high end spec pc gamer. Since I'm also a pc gamer I got to talk about the graphics, they literally are MIND blowing for the PS3, I sometimes just stopped playing and just started looking at the graphics. This game could be my favorite game of ALL time and I've played games for a long time. Hats of to Naught dog for making this amazing game. This is easily going to be my game of the year but I really recommend Bioshock, up yours GTA! buy yo though!)\n",

            "This game delivers in every way you'd expect from this genre. I was amazed at how attached I was to the characters and the story. actually care more about these characters than almost the entire crew of the walking dead) The pacing, story telling, gameplay, graphics, everything here is top notch. I can't find a fault in this game at all. It just delivers. The only downside is that the game is over now and I'm left waiting for the next installment. This game is a truly phenomenal game,I literally cannot find an issue with it. It will draw you into the characters and make you genuinely care for them, the voice acting is flawless, and overall the game is fantastic from start to finish, and oh god that finish. The Last of Us. A game that will be remembered. Naughty Dog have made a masterpiece. The Last of Us brings you a story that will touch you. The characters, the world and overall the gameplay itself make this game the best that I've ever played. Joel and Ellie are characters that you will fall in love with The game tells the story of their relationship and how from totally disliking each other they become best friends and even more. Throughout the game you will find interesting items that you can use to craft bombs, shivs, med kits and other things to help you survive in the environment which is done beautifully. The combat system is one of the most interesting things you will see. It's not about run and gun, you have to use your brain and think before you act which will be a blast because of the many different ways to approach each fight. You can even chose to avoid conflict completely. The graphics of the game are one of the most satisfying graphics you'll see not because of how well they are done they are done VERY well) but because of the way they make the game look so believable and so much mor satisfying. You might find yourself crying while playing the game and you might feel attached to the character which will make you think about the world that we live in and how people treat one another. Joel and Ellie will touch your heart and you will have an experience that you would want to remember forever and make you wish that they were real. Truth be told this is a game not for the faint of hart but its compelling story and imaginative villains make this an unmissable game for any gamer that is brave enough to play it. It also has amazing multiplier mechanics that will be the bench mark for next gen online gaming. What hasn't been said about this game that hasn't already been said. This game is a masterpiece, a stroke of pure genius from Naughty Dog. From the story to the multiplayer, there is no excuse not to play this game. Its a force of nature. The story is unforgivingly tragic and straight forward, unlike most games on the market. The performances are Oscar worthy and deserve nearly all the praise it's been getting. The multiplayer is fantastic and is a breath of fresh air for Battlefield or CoD fans. If you own a PS3, there is no reason that you shouldn't buy this game, it's a masterpiece.\n"
